Please review the original image and the edited image, both labeled as 'A'. The original image serves as a baseline and will not be evaluated. Your task is to assess the quality of 'A', with a particular focus on naturalness and the presence or absence of artifacts. Evaluate how effectively each algorithm maintains the integrity of the original image while implementing modifications. Pay attention to any signs of distortion, unnatural colors, pixelation, or other visual inconsistencies.

Rate each image on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents excellent quality with seamless modifications, and 1 indicates poor quality with significant and noticeable artifacts. Provide a detailed analysis for each rating, highlighting specific aspects of the image that influenced your evaluation. Please ensure that your responses are in English.
