Please review the following: Original Image, Edited Image 'A', and Mask Image 'M'. The original image serves as a baseline and will not be evaluated. The mask image highlights the areas intended for editing, where the value '1' indicates the regions to be modified.

Your tasks are:
1. Assess the Quality of the Edited Image 'A': Evaluate the edited image with a particular focus on naturalness and the presence or absence of artifacts, specifically within the regions indicated by the mask. Also, note any unintended changes outside the masked areas.

2. Rate the Image: Provide a rating on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 represents excellent quality with seamless modifications confined to the masked areas, and 0 indicates poor quality with significant and noticeable artifacts or unintended changes.

3. Detailed Analysis: Offer a detailed analysis supporting your rating, highlighting specific aspects of the image that influenced your evaluation, including any changes outside the intended edit regions.

4. Regeneration Recommendation: Based on your assessment, determine whether the image needs to be regenerated. If you recommend regeneration, specify the reasons and suggest what aspects need improvement. Leave the value blank if it is not required

5. Non-Overflow Editing Guidance: If Regeneration Recommendation is required, fill in the blank value. Considering that Stable Diffusion or other edited tool may alter content outside the intended masked regions, provide guidance on how to paste the edited content back into the original image using the mask. Explain the steps to ensure that only the desired regions are updated, maintaining the integrity of the rest of the image.
