**Analysis Requirements:**

**I. Analysis of Edited Content**

**Position Description:**
Use natural language to describe the relative and absolute positions of the edited regions within the images.

**Content Description:**

- **Object Types:** Provide a detailed description of the types of objects or components involved in the tampered areas.
- **Quantity:** Indicate the number of edited objects, if applicable.
- **Actions or Postures:** Describe the actions, postures, or states of the objects within the edited areas.
- **Attributes and Features:** Include characteristics such as size, color, texture, orientation, material, shadows, and other relevant features.
- **Naturalness Evaluation:** Assess whether the tampered content appears natural and if there are any anomalies that make it stand out from the surrounding regions.

------

**II. Semantic-Level Analysis Inside and Outside the Edited Areas**

- **Multimodal Information Consistency:** Check for consistency between text, symbols, and visual content in the image, and identify any logical contradictions.
- **Text Content Coherence:** Evaluate the logical coherence of any textual elements in the image and whether they align with the expected theme and background.
- **Format and Layout Normativity:** Examine whether the image adheres to standard templates, including paragraph structures, title styles, and other formatting norms.
- **Visual Forgery Traces:** Identify inconsistencies at the edges, signs of obvious modifications or deletions, and pay attention to possible cloning or splicing traces.
- **Misleading Content:** Look for content that violates common sense, physical laws, or contains misleading elements.
- **Temporal and Spatial Consistency:** Verify the reasonableness of time and spatial relationships among elements in the image, such as the alignment of seasons, weather conditions, and scenes.
- **Metadata Analysis:** Examine the image's EXIF information, including the camera model, shooting date and time, geographic location, and other metadata for inconsistencies or signs of tampering.
- **Cultural and Symbol Consistency:** Verify that symbols, language, and cultural elements present in the image are consistent with the intended background setting.
- **Other Semantic Anomalies:** Identify any additional anomalies at the semantic level that may indicate forgery.

------

**III. Visual-Level Analysis Inside and Outside the Edited Areas**

- **Physical Feature Verification:** Detect whether the proportions, sizes, and relative positions of objects in the scene are reasonable, and identify any abnormal collisions or deformations.
- **Naturalness of Lighting Distribution:** Examine the naturalness of lighting and shadow effects, including light source direction, shadow length, and brightness distribution.
- **Perspective and Angle Consistency:** Ensure that the perspective relationships and viewing angles of all objects are consistent, avoiding distortions or mismatches.
- **Color Uniformity:** Identify any color discrepancies caused by forgery and check for consistency in white balance and overall color tone.
- **Texture Feature Analysis:** Ensure that textures match real-world expectations, paying attention to the continuity of textures and any repetitive patterns.
- **Reflection and Refraction Consistency:** Check the correctness of effects like mirror reflections, water reflections, and transparency.
- **Edge Artifact Detection:** Look for edge feathering or hard-edge issues resulting from cutting, copying, or pasting operations.
- **Blur and Focus:** Evaluate depth-of-field effects and check whether the sharpness of foreground and background elements is appropriate.
- **Motion Blur and Dynamic Indicators:** Determine whether moving elements in the image exhibit consistent motion blur effects.
- **Other Visual Anomalies:** Identify any additional visual irregularities that may suggest image manipulation.

------

**IV. Pixel-Level Analysis Inside and Outside the Edited Areas**

- **Noise Distribution Detection:** Analyze noise patterns across different regions to identify areas with artificially added noise or inconsistent noise levels.
- **Watermark Content Detection:** Check the integrity and placement of watermark information, noting any signs of removal or overlay.
- **Compression Artifact Recognition:** Determine if the image has undergone varying degrees of compression and analyze differences in JPEG compression artifacts.
- **Frequency Domain Feature Analysis:** Utilize Fourier transforms and other methods to detect abnormal frequency components, identifying frequency domain differences in forged areas.
- **Color Space Analysis:** Compare differences in color spaces such as RGB and HSV to locate regions with unnatural color transitions.
- **Pixel-Level Discontinuity:** Detect abrupt changes or anomalies in pixel values, such as irregular pixel gradients.
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA):** Use error level analysis to detect compression residues in different regions, identifying potential tampered areas.
- **Steganography and Data Embedding Detection:** Check for signs of hidden information or data embedding within the image.
- **EXIF and File Attribute Verification:** Confirm consistency between file creation dates, modification dates, camera models, geographic locations, and the image content.
- **Other Pixel-Level Anomalies:** Identify any additional pixel-level irregularities that may indicate manipulation.

------

**V. Grading Standards for the Difficulty of Forensic Analysis**

Based on the analysis results, assign a grade to the image's traceability and provide reasons:

- **Easy:** Obvious forgery features are present, such as rough cut-and-paste or evident splicing traces; both the naked eye and standard forensic tools can accurately detect them.
- **Moderate:** The forgery traces are complex but can be identified through detailed analysis, such as color discrepancies or inconsistent lighting.
- **Difficult:** The forgery is sophisticated; even with advanced technical analysis, traces of manipulation are hard to detect and require high-level technical means.
- **Undetectable:** There is insufficient information or technical means to determine authenticity; forgery traces are extremely subtle, or additional information is needed.
